// Notes
// This language is a part/subsystem of TypeScript, I don't know how much it deviates from normal TypeScript

// Project language file 1
// For: seanpm2001/Learn-TSX
// About:
// I decided to make TSX the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-TSX) as TSX is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the TSX programming language. It only makes sense to TSX the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
